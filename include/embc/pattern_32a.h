/**
 * @ingroup embc
 * @defgroup embc_pattern_32a Test pattern generator and receiver for 32-bit values.
 *
 * @brief Generate and receive a test pattern consisting of 32-bit values.
 *
 * The pattern consists of two interleaved patterns that alternate with
 * each 32-bit value.
 *
 * The first pattern is a single bit which is shifted from
 * the least significant bit to the most significant bit and then to zero.
 * Once the value is zero, the least significant bit is set again.  The pattern
 * period is 33 values (value 0 + 32 values for each bit set).  This pattern
 * allows rapid detection of shorts and opens.
 *
 * The second pattern is a 16-bit counter which contains the counter and
 * bit inverse in the upper 16-bits.  The period is 2^16 = 65536.  This
 * pattern creates a much longer period suitable for reliability detecting
 * lost/duplicated words and blocks in the datapath.
 *
 * Since 33 and 65536 share no common denominators, the total period is
 * 33 * 65536 * 2 = 4325376 words.  The additional factor of 2 is because the
 * patterns are interleaved for 2 words per total pattern value.
 *
 * This pattern generator can reliably detect repeated words and any skips up
 * to half the the total period.  Skips longer than half the total period
 * are presumed to be duplicates.  The receiver only takes two consecutive
 * correct words to resynchronize to the transmitter.
